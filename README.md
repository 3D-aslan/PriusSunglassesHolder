# Prius Gen 5 – Sunglasses Holder (3D Printed)

This is a custom sunglasses holder I designed for the 2023–2024 Toyota Prius.  
The car doesn’t have a good storage spot for sunglasses, so I made a part that fits securely in the center area and holds the glasses without scratching them.

## How it was made
**Tools I used:**
- Einstar Vega (for reference scan)
- 3DS MAx (modeling)
- Bambu Lab P1S (printing)
- ASA filament

**Process:**
1. Took measurements from the center console area  
2. Modeled the holder in Fusion 360  
3. Adjusted the angles so the sunglasses sit gently  
4. Added soft curves to avoid scratching  
5. Test printed 2–3 versions until fit was perfect  
6. Final version clicks into place without glue
